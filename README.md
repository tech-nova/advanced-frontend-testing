# Advanced Frontend Testing Workshop

Welcome to the Advanced Frontend Testing Workshop!

## Setup

Just run `npm install` in the root directory and it will install the dependencies for all the exercises.

## Commands

To run the dev server for a specific exercise:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Working on the exercises

Each exercise has a `problem` and `solution` folder. The `problem` folder contains the initial state of the exercise, described in the `README.md` file. The `solution` folder contains the final state of the exercise.

Each exercise problem has a `README` with instructions on what to do. If you ever get stuck, there are hints in the `README` if you click on the toggles.

**Note:** You should right click and "Open Preview" with the `README.md` file so you can view this as rendered Markdown. It will prevent you from accidentally seeing the hints. You can also view in Github if you prefer.

<details>
  <summary>They look like this</summary>

    This is a hint!

There are a lot of sub-tasks in each exercise!

Don't worry if you don't finish them all. The point is to get your brain involved and to make some progress.

Use the hints as you need if you ever get stuck for too long on something.

Once you've had a chance to work on an exercise for a while, I'll go through the solution, then do a bit more teaching. This is your chance to ask questions.

We'll repeat this cycle a bunch of times to complete the workshop.
