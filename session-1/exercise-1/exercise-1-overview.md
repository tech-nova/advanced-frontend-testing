# Exercise 1: Understanding Test Types

## Overview

### **Context**

We often get stuck wondering which type of test to write and when. Each test type—unit, component, integration, and end-to-end—serves a unique purpose. However, choosing the right type for the job can be confusing, especially when multiple options seem valid. In this exercise, we’ll dig into each type to better understand their roles and limitations.

### **Learning Outcome**

By the end of this exercise, you will have a clear understanding of what each test type can and cannot do, and how they fit into a balanced testing strategy. You'll be equipped to make informed decisions about which test type to use based on the needs of your application.

### **Motivation**

Choosing the right test type is crucial for efficient testing and effective code maintenance. Using the wrong type can lead to slow feedback, fragile tests, and wasted effort. Mastering this skill helps us write tests that provide valuable feedback and keep our codebase robust and maintainable.

### **Problem Statement**

You need to implement a testing strategy, but you're unsure when to use unit, component, integration, or end-to-end tests. You will work through each test type to determine it’s key attributes: what it means when it fails, the feedback it gives you as you write it, and it’s limitations.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Recognize Test Types and Purposes**: You’ll be able to define each test type in your own words and understand its unique role.
- **Understand Feedback from Tests**: Learn to interpret what different types of failing tests indicate about your application.
- **Identify Gaps in Test Coverage**: Recognize what each test type cannot tell you, and where you might need additional testing to cover those gaps.
