# Solution 1

Define each test type in your own words (unit, component, integration, E2E).

## Unit Tests

A unit test is a test that focuses on individual pieces of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the application. They often focus on implementation details to ensure that the logic behaves as expected without considering external dependencies.

## Component Tests

A component test is a test that evaluates how a Vue component integrates with its dependencies (like child components, stores, and services) as a whole, treating it as a mini application. The goal is to validate its behavior and state changes from a user's perspective, without mocking dependencies.

## Integration Tests

An integration test is a test that examines how multiple parts of the system that we own work together, including components, services, and backend APIs. The goal is to ensure that everything we control works together as expected without mocking or faking any internal dependencies.

## E2E Tests

An end-to-end test is a test that simulates real user interactions across the entire application, including parts we don't own, such as third-party APIs, external services, and authentication systems. They test the complete user journey to ensure the entire system, including both owned and external components, works as intended in real-world scenarios.
