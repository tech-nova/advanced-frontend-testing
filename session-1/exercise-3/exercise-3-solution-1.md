# Problem 1

Look at the Dockings tab in the app.

What is the core user flow for this feature?

1. **View Docking Information**: The user opens the app and can view a list of past, current, and scheduled dockings.

2. **Schedule a Docking**: The user clicks a button to schedule a new docking for the future.

3. **Record a Scan of a Docking**: For currently docked spacecraft, the user can click a button that opens a modal to record a scan of the docking.

4. **View Recorded Scan**: After the scan has been recorded, the user can view the scan report for that docking.
