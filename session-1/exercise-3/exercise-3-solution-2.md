# Problem 2: Prioritize only the core e2e tests

## 1. Sketch out some e2e tests, writing their name and a short description of each

**View Docking History and Scheduled Dockings**
Test that the user can view the list of past, current, and scheduled dockings.

**Schedule a New Docking**
Test that the user can successfully schedule a new docking and that it shows up in the scheduled dockings list.

**Record Docking Scan**
Test that the user can open the modal, record a scan for a currently docked spacecraft, and confirm the scan is saved.

**View Docking Scan Report**
Test that the user can view the recorded scan after it has been reported.

## 2. If you can only keep one test, which one and why?

View Docking History and Scheduled Dockings.

It's the main thing, and without it working none of the features will work.
