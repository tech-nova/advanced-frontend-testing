# Exercise 3: Test Case Planning and Prioritization

## Overview

### **Context**

You've just completed implementing a new feature in our app, but before we get too excited about pushing it live, we need to make sure it's covered by the right tests. The feature itself is straightforward, but determining how to effectively test it can be tricky, especially when considering the balance between e2e, component, and unit tests.

### **Learning Outcome**

By the end of this exercise, you'll be able to strategically plan and prioritize test cases for a new feature, understanding when to focus on different test types and why each is important in its own way.

### **Motivation**

Test coverage is crucial, but writing every possible test isn't realistic or necessary. Being able to prioritize tests that provide the most value not only saves time but also ensures that we catch the most critical issues with minimal effort.

### **Problem Statement**

You’ve just finished writing a new feature, and now you need to plan out the test cases. We won’t be writing the actual tests yet, just outlining which tests are most important and why. We'll start by identifying the core user flow, then narrow down the key e2e, component, and unit tests for this feature.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Recognize High-Value Tests**: Understand how to identify which tests provide the most value for a given feature.
- **Balancing Test Types**: Discover when to choose e2e tests over unit or component tests, and vice versa, based on the feature requirements and context.
