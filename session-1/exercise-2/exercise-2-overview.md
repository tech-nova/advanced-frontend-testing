# Exercise 2: Testing Strategy Based on Project Factors

## Overview

### **Context**

In this exercise, we’ll explore how various project factors like architecture, tech stack, team size, and project complexity influence our testing strategy. For instance, testing a small startup app with a simple monolithic structure is very different from testing a large enterprise application using microservices, managed by hundreds of engineers and supported by dedicated QA teams.

### **Learning Outcome**

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to craft a testing strategy that adapts to the needs and constraints of different project sizes, architectures, and team compositions, understanding how each factor shapes your approach.

### **Motivation**

Creating a flexible testing strategy is crucial because one size doesn’t fit all. Factors like architecture, team size, and tech stack can dramatically impact the way we test our applications. Understanding how to adapt your strategy based on these factors helps maintain efficiency and code quality as projects evolve.

### **Problem Statement**

You’re working on projects of varying sizes and complexities with different architectures and tech stacks. How do you balance different test types (unit, component, integration, and end-to-end) based on these factors, and how do these factors influence your testing priorities?

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Adaptable Strategies**: You’ll learn how to adjust your testing strategy as project size, architecture, and tech stack evolve, making your testing efforts more efficient and effective.
- **Critical Decision Making**: You’ll understand which areas to prioritize for testing and which to skip based on project constraints, including architecture and technology choices.
