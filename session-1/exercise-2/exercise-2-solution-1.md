# Problem 1: Identify Project Factors and Their Impact on Testing

For each project factor, write a brief explanation of how it influences the testing strategy.

## Project Size

**Description**: Refers to the scale of the project, such as a small startup app, a medium-sized product, or a large enterprise application.

**Impact on Testing Strategy**:
Larger projects typically require more comprehensive and scalable testing approaches. Testing may need to be distributed across multiple teams, and automation becomes crucial.

## Architecture Type

**Description**: The structural design of the application, such as monolithic, microservices, or microfrontends.

**Impact on Testing Strategy**:
Different architectures influence the granularity and focus of tests. Monolithic architectures might focus more on integration tests, while microservices require extensive contract testing (testing the APIs that connect the services) and isolated unit tests.

## Tech Stack

**Description**: The technologies used in the project, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, or REST APIs.

**Impact on Testing Strategy**:
The tech stack determines what needs to be tested. For instance, TypeScript reduces the need for some unit tests due to type checking, while GraphQL queries may need specific validation.

## Team Size

**Description**: The number of developers involved in the project, ranging from small teams (3-5 developers) to large teams (100+ developers).

**Impact on Testing Strategy**:
Larger teams need more coordination and possibly shared test libraries. Testing responsibilities and policies must be clear to maintain consistency across the codebase.

## QA Resources

**Description**: Availability of dedicated Quality Assurance personnel, ranging from no QA support to full-time QA teams.

**Impact on Testing Strategy**:
The presence of QA teams can offload some testing responsibilities from developers, allowing them to focus on lower-level tests. Without QA, developers need to cover all types of tests themselves.
