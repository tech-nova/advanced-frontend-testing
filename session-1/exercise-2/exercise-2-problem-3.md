# Problem 3: Develop an Enterprise Testing Strategy

For this scenario, create a testing strategy by defining the testing shape and explaining your rationale.

## Scenario

**Description**: The company has grown significantly over the past decade and now has 200 developers and several dedicated QA teams. The application has evolved into a set of interconnected microservices.

## Define Your Testing Shape

**Task**: Draw (or type) a rough sketch of the testing pyramid, specifying the percentage distribution of unit, component, and end-to-end tests. Include how it has changed from the startup days.

**Your Testing Shape**:

                    /\
                   /  \
                  /    \
                 /      \
                /        \
               /          \
              /  E2E (__%) \
             /              \
            /                \
           /  Component (__%) \
          /                    \
         /                      \
        /        Unit (__%)      \
       /                          \
      /                            \
